# NEAR/Pagoda UI

A React component library that implements the official design system of NEAR and Pagoda. Feel free to open up new issues for any bugs that you run into or any features/components you'd like to see implemented.

*NOTE: As of now, this library has a peer dependency on Next JS since some of our components rely on `next/link` and hooks like `router.push()`. We'll look into refactoring the library soon to remove the Next JS requirement so that our library can be used within any React framework.*
